## Run script using:
```bash

## From assignment page:
> "Always include a readme file in your submission that describes for each file in the implementation what this file does, and how the program is supposed to be executed. Do this also when you have only a single file.  
Don't forget to keep track of the tasks and hours for each team member to include in the contribution table in the report. You can also include the current version of the contribution table in the intermediate submission to receive feedback.  
If you know there are large flaws or missing functionality in your code then please mark this clearly in the code and readme file.  
Reminder: submit only .py files, not .ipynb files."
