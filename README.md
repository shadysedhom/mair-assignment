*From assignment page:*
> "Always include a readme file in your submission that describes for each file in the implementation what this file does, and how the program is supposed to be executed. Do this also when you have only a single file.   

> Don't forget to keep track of the tasks and hours for each team member to include in the contribution table in the report. You can also include the current version of the contribution table in the intermediate submission to receive feedback.   

> If you know there are large flaws or missing functionality in your code then please mark this clearly in the code and readme file.   

> Reminder: submit only .py files, not .ipynb files."

# Methods in AI Research | Dialogue Act Classifier

This project implements and evaluates several machine learning models for classifying dialogue acts in a restaurant-domain dataset.

## Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run script
```bash
py main.py
```
This will run the full pipeline, including training, testing and user interaction. Some training results are cached in the repository for efficiency.

## File Descriptions

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python packages required to run this project.
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the project. It orchestrates the entire workflow: loading and splitting the data, and calling the different classifier implementations.
- **`data.py`**: Contains functions related to data loading and preparation.
  - `load_and_preprocess_data()`: Loads the raw `dialog_acts.dat` file, cleans the data by handling utterances which were fully unintelligible and rows with null labels, and converts it to a pandas DataFrame.
  - `split_data()`: Splits the DataFrame into training (75%), validation (10%), and test sets (15%).
- **`svm.py`**: Contains the implementation for Classifier 3 (Support Vector Machine). It uses the Optuna library to perform efficient hyperparameter optimization and caches the results to a `.pkl` file to save time on subsequent runs. Function used to avoid repetition when training the 2 SVM's.
- **`optuna_study_svm_*.pkl`**: These are cached result files generated by `svm.py` after running the hyperparameter optimization. You can safely delete them to force the optimization to run again.
