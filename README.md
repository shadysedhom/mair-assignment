# Methods in AI Research | Dialogue Act Classifier

This project implements and evaluates several machine learning models for classifying dialogue acts in a restaurant-domain dataset.

## Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run script
```bash
py main.py
```
This will run the full pipeline, including training, testing and user interaction. Some training results are cached in the repository for efficiency.

## File Descriptions

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python packages required to run this project.
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the project. It orchestrates the entire workflow of data loading, model training, and launching the interactive command-line interface.
- **`cli.py`**: Defines the `start_cli` function, which provides an interactive prompt for users to classify their own sentences using the trained models.
- **`data.py`**: Contains functions related to data loading and preparation.
  - `load_and_preprocess_data()`: Loads the raw `dialog_acts.dat` file, cleans the data by handling utterances which were fully unintelligible and rows with null labels, and converts it to a pandas DataFrame.
  - `split_data()`: Splits the DataFrame into training (75%), validation (10%), and test sets (15%).
- **`svm.py`**: Contains the implementation for Classifier 3 (Support Vector Machine). It uses the Optuna library to perform efficient hyperparameter optimization and caches the results to a `.pkl` file to save time on subsequent runs. Function used to avoid repetition when training the 2 SVM's.
- **`optuna_study_svm_*.pkl`**: These are cached result files generated by `svm.py` after running the hyperparameter optimization. You can safely delete them to force the optimization to run again.
